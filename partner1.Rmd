My name is Jack Novak and my github username is jackcnovak. Eric's most recent commit, labeled 'Homework 1 commit,' added the .Rmd and .html files from HW 1 and had commit ID 5a772b23c66f3032faf77026abcc035d539ae110. I didn't run into any errors when I knitted Eric's HW 1 file. Finally, I didn't encounter too much difficulty, although I moved slowly at times because I'm somewhat unfamiliar with R.
